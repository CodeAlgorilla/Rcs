<!-- extents: Size of a cuboid that defines the inertia tensor          -->
<!-- cogVector: Vector from the body origin to the gravity center       -->
<!-- jointType: None, RotX, RotY, RotZ, XYThz, 6DOF (3 translations,    -->
<!--            3 Kardan rotations)                                     -->
<!-- jointVector: Vector from the previous body to the connecting joint,-->
<!--              represented in the coordinates of the previous body   -->
<!-- mass: Weight of the body in [kg]                                   -->
